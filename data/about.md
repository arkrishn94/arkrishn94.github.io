I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) where I build indexing and quantization algorithms that make vector search and retrieval-augmented generation production-ready. I work closely with product teams to translate database research into reliable ML-powered search experiences.

Before Pinecone, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University with [Vladimir Braverman](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vova/). I earned both my B.S. (2013–2017) and M.S. (2017–2018) in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to collaborate with [Anupam Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/), [Kirk Pruhs](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/), [David P. Woodruff](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/), and [Anil Ada](https://www.anilada.com/).
